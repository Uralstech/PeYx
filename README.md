# **PeYx**

## **What is PeYx?**
**PeYx is a Text Editor made with Python.**
It's a successor to [***WinSurfer's***](https://github.com/Uralstech/WinSurfer) built-in text editor. Here are some of it's features:
- **Undo and redo!**
- **Code highlighting! (*Only for Python files*)**
- **Easily changeable fonts and colors!**
- **Better looking graphics!**

## **How do I use PeYx?**
Here are some of the shortcuts:
- **Ctrl+n: Create new file**
- **Ctrl+o: Open file**
- **Ctrl+s: Save file**
- **Ctrl+s+a: Save-as file**
- **Ctrl+q: Increase text size**
- **Ctrl+e: Decrease text size**
- **F5: Run file (only for Python files)**

All other instructions should be obvious in the UI. (hopefully)
### NOTE: **This *should* work on MacOS and Linux, but I haven't tested it.**
